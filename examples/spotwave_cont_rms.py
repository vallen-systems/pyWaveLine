"""
Continuously compute and stream RMS values.

AE hit features (peak amplitude, rise time, duration, counts, energy) are directly computed on the
device with the maximum sampling rate of 2 MHz. RMS can be derived from energy and duration.
The computational load on the client side is minimal compared to transient data recording with
feature extraction on the raw data (2 MHz -> 4 MB/s).
